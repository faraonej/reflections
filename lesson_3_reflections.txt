When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - a remote repository would be useful if collaborating with folks via a public repo, or
 - if sharing with fokls who are geographically dispersed.
 
 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
	-  Because any changes made locally would automatically be clobbered. Law of Unintended Consequences!
