What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	- metadata about the repo is created and stored.
	- it's necessary because git needs to begin tracking the contents of the files and their states.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	- Staging is between the working directory and the repository; It holds files that are a step from being committed, 
	but can't be modified (other than being removed via 'git reset'.
	- Its value is that it can be a holding area for code containing mods or features for testing that can be backed out 
	in the working directory copy if testing fails.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	- the staging area allows you to comapre a working copy in the WD to the copy added to the staging area. 
	Using git diff shows what's been changed in the staged copy -- using git add, git diff prior to commit 
	allows comparison to ensure only one change per commit.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

		- Branches can be used to track changes to the master code base then joined to the Master after satisfactory testing
		- similarly branches can be used for experimentation on new features by keeping the Master branch intact.
		
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	- The diagrams identify parents of commits, Master, Branches, and unreachable branches.
	- Identifying unreachable branches can be joined to the master by doing a checkout of their commit
		
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	- Merging two branches creates a code base from the two (or more) branches into a single master with all 
	changes combined; the diagram shows this.
