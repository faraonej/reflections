When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - a remote repository would be useful if collaborating with folks via a public repo, or
 - if sharing with fokls who are geographically dispersed.
 
 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
	-  Because any changes made locally would automatically be clobbered. Law of Unintended Consequences!
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	* Fork -- used on GitHub to clone a repository for your own use, mostly for stuff you want to modify 
			  but have no rights to original repo.
			  
	* Clone -- used to copy a repo to your machine from GitHub or between repos on your machine.
	
	* Branch -- Used to modify/create a new code stream off a master within a repo, (either on GitHub 
				or on local git) maintaining the master while changes or features are added to the copy 
				of the master code base. Changes made to the branch do not affect the master until the 
				changes within the branch are merged with the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

					- A local copy of origin\master allows you to work from a sync'd repository if you don't
					  have Internet access.
					  
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	- We could use sharepoint or other shared directory with diff, but merges branches and forks would be 
	  a nightmare
